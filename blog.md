🛠️ Exploring Smarter Testing Workflows for Modern Projects
Recently, I took some time to reflect on the reliability of the systems we build—especially those involving APIs. While functionality is usually the first milestone we focus on, ensuring that everything works seamlessly over time is just as important.

As part of this thought process, I explored ways to simulate real-world usage patterns and test how my application would behave under different conditions. I stumbled upon an interesting testing approach that doesn’t require writing a lot of manual test cases—it instead learns from how the app is used and builds validations based on that.

What stood out to me was how easily it fit into an existing workflow. I tried it on a small project that involved both a client interface and a backend server. Setting it up locally was straightforward, and I was able to generate insights fairly quickly. Once it was working, I also experimented with integrating it into an automated pipeline—just to see how feasible it is to catch regressions without human involvement.

I didn’t dive too deep into the tooling specifics, but it was an eye-opener to see how modern solutions are blurring the line between development and testing. There’s a lot of potential in making our apps more resilient before issues even appear.

Still early days, but I’m excited to see where this line of thinking goes.
